The challenge provides the hint where to find the flag. Since the flag is found outside the image, the dimensions need to be expanded. This can be accomplished by using HexEd to overwrite certain byte values to increase height and width of an image. Opening the image in HexEd and searching for FF C0 or FF C2 will locate the bytes that need to be modified. The 7 bytes after the found bytes are what you need. The 4th and 5th bytes are for height and the 6th and 7th are for width. Locate the current image resolution size, convert the bigger number into hexadecimal and adjust the bytes accordingly. In this case, adjusting the image from 2016x900 to 2016x2000 reveals the flag.
