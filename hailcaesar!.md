Examining the image with
```bash
strings HailCaesar.jpg
```
and scrolling to the top of the output, reveals a few fake flags and encoded strings. The fake flags provide a clue that a shift of all printable ASCII characters is neccessary. For this purpose, a Python program is a good choice.
```python
def decrypt(cipher_text, shift):
  result = ""
  for char in cipher_text:
    ascii_value = ord(char)
    if 32 <= ascii_value <= 126:
      normalized = ascii_value - 32
      shifted = (normalized - shift) % 95
      result += chr(shifted + 32)
    else:
      result += char
  return result

def brute_force(cipher_text):
  for shift in range(95):
    decrypted = decrypt(cipher_text, shift)
    print(f"Shift {shift:2}: {decrypted}")

cipher = input("Enter cipher text: ")
brute_force(cipher)
```
Running this program and inserting the first string reveals no information, and the second string is encoded in base64, but also serves no purpose. The answer is in the third and final string, which reveals the flag on Shift 18.
